What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with the merge concepts. But I figured it out.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The mv, merge, and push functions were clarified functions

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked them some questions about markdown and about how to add comments directly in the shell

What still confuses you about Git?
Nothing conceptually thus far. I think I just need to make the workflow more reflexive.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
it was good! Jose was an excellent partner
